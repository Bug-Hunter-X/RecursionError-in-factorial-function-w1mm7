This repository contains a simple Python program that demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: the lack of a proper base case for negative input.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, which will raise a `RecursionError` when called with a negative number.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected code with an appropriate base case to handle this error.  The error is easily fixed by adding a check for negative input and returning an appropriate value (e.g., raising a ValueError) or handling the error gracefully.
